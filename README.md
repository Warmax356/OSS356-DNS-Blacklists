## :grey_question: FAQ

- Why do i need to blacklist on my network?
- There many systems and tehcnologies on the web may be used for malicious intent such as computer intrusions, data-mining, Ads, Telemetry, fraud, phishing and other data-sets that may be used against you or others. This is why the community Open Source Society Malta and its global partners on this project, hate it when such methods are used to impersonate trusted or influential institutions, people, brands and the companies you do business with in & around Malta. Thus community has partnered up with War Max IT and others who form part of the digital & cyber security community in Malta and Globally to provide a comprehensive awareness of tools and utilities to help stay safe on the web and to keep your data safe.
- But How do i spot a bad actor?
- An Example of some of the potential malicious methods used is to trick unsuspecting victims with IDN characters such as ł in iCłoud.com or the zero in Micr0Soft.com
- What Platform or APP can i use for these lists?
- As a network-wide DNS blocker, we recommend using Adguard Home, Pi-hole, TechnitiumDNS, Blocky, adblock-lean, OpenWrt or eBlocker.
- But what does a DNS blocker do?
- DNS blockers offer good protection of privacy by blocking tracking, metrics and telemetry. They can be used to block the vast majority of ads, malware, scam, fake and co, but not everything can be blocked at the DNS level!
- But what about when i am on the go and/or dont have network control?
- If you are unable to VPN into your protected network, we additionally recommend the use of a browser content blocker such as AdGuard, uBlock Origin or Ghostery.
- How is Blacklist Data collected?
- Data is collected from multiple sources, these are: – By You via Submission form below – Goverment agencies that regulate the market such as the advisories from MFSA and MGA (for Malta list, among others for global lists) – Community via submissions and secuirty projects (like the other blacklists mentioned below) – Companies usally have IT departments that also contribute to Blacklist community project as they benefit from it too – OSINT (open source intelligence) data points
- What about a Whitelist for pi-hole v6+?
- We do have a community white list available in ad-block format for now – this can be found on our website and is currently a works in progress <=> please use whitelists with caution, ossmalta is not responsible if the listed urls get breached.
